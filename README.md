# Web and TV Interest Group
This is the Github repository for the W3C Web and TV Interest Group (Web&TV IG), used to organize work in the IG. Higher-level information about the Web&TV IG is available on [the charter](http://www.w3.org/2012/11/webTVIGcharter.html) and [the main home page of the group](http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/). The Interest Group reviews existing work and identifies requirements and potential solutions for the Web and TV. The development of Web standards, when required, takes place in other working groups.
